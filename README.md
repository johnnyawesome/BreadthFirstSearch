Breadth First Search is an Algorithm that finds the path with the fewest hops (passing the fewest number of Nodes) in an unweighted Graph.

This Project generates random Graphs and  chooses a Start-Node and an End-Node, and uses the Breadth First Search Algorithm to find the shortest Path between those two points.
